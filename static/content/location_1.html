<p>Pub ambience of drinks clinking, men chattering, beer being
poured into glass steins.</p>
<p> 
The year is 1828 and two strangers
have just immigrated to this dark and
dingy city. They're using what money
they have to enjoy a pint at the pub
where they meet for the first time.</p>
<p>
The doors burst open, <strong>BURKE</strong> saunters in
defeated, drops onto a bar stool, slams money onto a wooden
counter. The pub is fairly quiet apart from a few regulars,
<strong>HARE</strong> and two <strong>STUDENTS</strong> conversing over their course at the
local Medical School.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Pint please.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BAR MAID... </strong>
Yes sir.
</p>
The <strong>BAR MAID</strong> rushes off, pours a pint, places it down in
front of Burke on the wooden counter and takes the money
gingerly.
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Rough day?
</p>
Burke takes a glug of his pint and slams it back down, wiping froth from his moustache.
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
You wouldn't know the half of it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Think I would. Got a Tennant that
hasn't been paying his rent lately.
Barely paid for my pint I'm struggling
that much because of him.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Some people are unreal. What's your
name?
</p>
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Hare. You?
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
I'm Burke. What you drinking Hare?
Next one's on me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
I'll take a whiskey please.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Sure.
</p>
Burke hits the bar twice to get the Bar Maid's attention.
<p>
<strong>BAR MAID... </strong>
Can I help you sir?
</p>
Burke slams money onto the wooden counter.
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Get this one a whiskey.
</p>
<p>
<strong>BAR MAID... </strong>
Certainly.
</p>
The Bar Maid rushes off, pours a whiskey and places it in
front of Hare. She then takes the money quietly and rushes
off. Hare picks up the whiskey and turns to face Burke.
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>Cheers!
</p>
They both drink.
<p>
<strong>STUDENT 1... </strong> 
Yeah I know, I agree totally. They had
fifty of us crowded round a tiny
dissection table last Wednesday!
Couldn't see a bloody thing. Honestly
sick of them packing the classes so
full because of low supply.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STUDENT 2... </strong>
It's a shame we can't get more bodies
though, Dr. Knox pays a pretty penny
for them. The school isn't struggling
for money either.
</p>
<p>
Burke and Hare look at each other
slowly. It's at this moment that the
pair put their sinister minds together
to scheme up an idea of how they are
going to fix their... Financial
 ... I hope you have a candle situation
lit, because our next location is
going to be dark. Who knows what lies
round the corner? (scary laugh)...</p>
