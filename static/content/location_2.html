Creepy outdoor ambience - Owl, crickets etc.

Having seen a body be buried very
recently, Burke and Hare are taking
the opportunity to quickly snatch the
body from the grave. They are avoiding
the guards in the watch tower because
body snatching is illegal...

<p><strong>HARE... </strong>
Careful now Burke. We can get in lots
of trouble if we're caught.
</p>

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
But if we aren't caught we'll be
rolling in money! Let's dig this poor
bastard up!
</p>
Quick footsteps on a ground sodden with damp leaves approach.

<p>
<strong>SECURITY GUARD... </strong>
Oi! You get here!
</p>

Burke and Hare weren't successful this
time. How on earth are they going to
achieve their plan if they can't even
catch a dead person? Well, we'll see
at our next location, Tanner's Close!
