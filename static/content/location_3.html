That was a close one! Unsuccessful
with snatching a body from the grave,
Burke and Hare reconvene again at
Hare's house in Tanner's Close. It's
here that they strike lucky! Here they
come!

Burke and Hare are running as fast as they can through the
desolate streets towards Burke's tenement house.

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
That was bloody close!
</p>

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong> 
Come on, I have an idea. Inside...
</p>

Burke and Hare burst through the tenemant door and run up
several flights of wooden stairs. They stop at Hare's door.

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Keep quiet, old Jim will hear you.
</p>

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Alright.
</p>

Hare quietly opens the door, creeps in, closes the door and
locks it.

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
In here...
</p>

Burke and Hare creep into the kitchen. JIM can be heard
retching, coughing, spluttering and vomiting into a wooden
bucket.

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Remember how I told you I was having
issues with a tenant paying?
</p>

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Yeah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Well we could use his body for our
first payment. He's due me anyway.
</p>

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Good idea! How long do you think it'll
be 'til he's dead?
</p>

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Hopefully not too long, he's on his
last legs for sure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
We could just speed up the inevitable?
</p>

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
If we must. I need the money paid back
as soon as possible...
</p>

As suspected, it didn't take long at
all. Burke and Hare shove old Jim's
corpse into a wheelbarrow and take him
to the medical school to meet with Dr.
Knox. Now travel to Surgeon's Hall
where Burke and Hare make an
interesting discovery which will drive
their infamous crimes.
