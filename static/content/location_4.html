<strong>HARE...</strong>
We thought it would be best to come and see you.
</p>

<p>
<strong>DR. KNOX... </strong>
Yes, thanks lads! Here you go.

Dr. Knox dumps a massive sack of money on the table.

<p>
<strong>DR. KNOX... </strong>
I'm disappointed though. Fresh bodies
sell for more money...

Burke and Hare look at each other
again. They decide to head back to
Hare's to plot their next move. Follow
the route they take to find out what
