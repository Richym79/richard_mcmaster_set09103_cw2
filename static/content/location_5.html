Burke and Hare are walking back to Hare's house. They are
walking past a pub. The men slow down.

<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Hare, have you got a match? </p>

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
No I don't. Had to give up my smokes
when Jim didn't pay me for a couple
months. Have you got one spare?
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Sure do. Here you go. I'll find us a
match.
</p>
Hare walks over to the pub and approaches someone leaving the
pub.
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Got a spare match?... Thanks.
</p>
Burke lights his cigarette and returns to Hare.
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Take a light off mine.
</p>
Hare lights his cigarette from Burke's cigarette and inhales.

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Money's good for the lungs!
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
You're right brother! Where's our next
body coming from then? Needs to be
fresh.
</p>

<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
We need to pick someone nobody will
miss, someone nobody will even notice
is gone...
</p>
Burke and Hare's conversation is cut off by the sound of skuffling and smashing glass. They freeze and listen intently
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Did you hear that?
</p>
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Let's take a closer look.
</p>
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Sounds like it came from the back of
the pub by the stairs. Come on.
</p>

Burke and Hare sneak up to the top of the stairs.
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
It's just a bum.
</p>

Burke and Hare look at each other again...
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Let me do the honours.
</p>

Burke shoves the BUM down the stairs. The Bum yells out as he
tumbles to the bottom. His cries are silenced by several
cracking sounds and he lands at the bottom mute.
<p>
<strong>BURKE... </strong>
Well that was easy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>HARE... </strong>
Great work Burke. Let's get us some
more money.
</p>
Burke and Hare pass slowly and quietly
through the eerie streets of
Edinburgh, heaving the body through
the tunnel with them as they did with
the 13 other victims which followed
this murder.
<br>
Now make your way to the Cowgate
tunnel. It was here that Burke and
Hare found their next and last victim
and made a momentous mistake.
