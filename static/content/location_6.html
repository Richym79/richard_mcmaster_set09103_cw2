Night time ambience of the street.

Welcome to the Cowgate. It is here
Burke and Hare found their last
victim... Daft Jamie. 
<p>
Little did Burke and Hare know that Daft Jamie was a
well-known character around Edinburgh.
His shoeless feet and limp made him
stand out as prey as he wandered
through the Grassmarket on a frosty
night. Burke and Hare wasted no time -
they lured Jamie in with alcohol and
urged him to drink.
</p>
<p>
The morning after, Burke and Hare delivered Daft Jamie's
body to Doctor Knox. Doctor Knox was
worried as he had heard his students
talking about the disappearance of
Daft Jamie after presenting him on the
dissection table. Jamie's body could
be easily identified due to his club
feet and so in a state of panic,
Doctor Knox cut off Jamie's face and
feet to ensure that no one could
identify Jamie.
</p>
<p>
However, someone has
to hang for the crimes. Make your way
to the Grassmarket to decide what
happens next.
